# IoPagoTasse - Curbing Labor Exploitation Using Javascript(React) And Java(Spring)

Labor exploitation of migrants in southern Europe has become infamous over the years. The exploited either do not understand the language or have little understanding of the importance of paying taxes. ioPagoTasse, as a web application, will be directing interested individuals towards tax and financial advisers who will help them create a better path towards taxes and pensions.

On this application, only known tax personnel in specific regions who meet our specific demands will be accepted as registered users of the platform. Once demands are met, users will be published within their regions so they can be reached by interested users.
